The semester is almost finished, so I finally get a change to upload something to this blog, I'll begin with the first things we saw on the "Laboratory of electromagnetic devices" class.  
For this class session we were asked "How does the electric resistance of a wire depends on its length and cross-sectional area?" and then we were given three nichrome wires of 1mm diameter each, a rule and a multimeter, then I started to take resistance measurements in steps of 5 cm for one, two and three threaded wires

<table class="centerfy">

Then I did four scatter plots of the data, three of lenght vs resistance for each threaded wire and one of cross-sectional area vs resistance at 20cm of length 
<div>
<table class="centerfy">
<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Length vs resistance with one 1mm wire</td>
				<td>Length vs resistance with two 1mm wires</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
				<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-10-ohms-law/1mmplot.png"></td>
				<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-10-ohms-law/2mmplot.png"></td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
				<td>Length vs resistance with three 1mm wire</td>
				<td>Cross-sectional area vs resistance with three 20cm 1mm wires</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
				<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-10-ohms-law/3mmplot.png"></td>
				<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-10-ohms-law/123plot.png"></td>
			</tr>
</table>  
</div>  

As we can see from the plots, each of them have at least a 92% relation with a linear trend, also we can see that if we take measurements from a greater distance, the resistance goes up, and when we add more wires to the thread the resistance goes down. This means that the resistance of a material is directly proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area.  
# Why?
