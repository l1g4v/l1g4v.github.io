The semester is almost finished, so I finally get a change to upload something to this blog, I'll begin with the first things we saw on the "Laboratory of electromagnetic devices" class.  
For this class session we were asked "How does the electric resistance of a wire depends on its length and cross-sectional area?". We were given three nichrome wires of 1mm diameter each, a rule and a multimeter, then I started to take resistance measurements in steps of 5 cm for one, two and three threaded wires

<tr><th>1mm diameter </th><th>2mm diameter</th><th>3mm diameter</th></tr>
