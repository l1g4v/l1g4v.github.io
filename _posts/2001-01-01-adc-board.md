This is an ADC board PCB designed in KiCad. The main goal of this project was to create a high-speed data acquisition system that can be used for measuring fast signals as part of a bigger project involving signal processing. Since I had coupon for six layer PCBs I decided to design this ADC board with a six layer design to ensure proper signal integrity, minimize noise, small form factor and the use of in-pad vias.
## Design

The PCB was designed using KiCad using the HMCAD1511TR ADC chip as the main component for data acquisition and the AD8132 differential amplifier for signal conditioning.

## Manufacturing
The PCB was manufactured using a professional PCB manufacturing service. The components were soldered using a reflow soldering process to ensure proper connections and reliability also done by the manufacturer since some of the components were pretty much exotic and was a lot cheaper than having to order them separately.
