This is a motion capture project module PCB based on STM32. The main goal of this project was to create a modular motion capture system where more nodes can be added easily to cover larger areas and exchange sensor data. Also during this time PCB manufacturing was becoming more affordable, so I decided to design my own PCB for this project with a 4 layer design since I had a coupon and this allowed for a smaller form factor.

## Design

The PCB was designed using KiCad.

The idea of this design is to have a node communicate with multiple sensor nodes. Each sensor node has an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to capture motion data and a microcontroller to process and send the data to the main controller. The main controller being the first node of the chain then aggregates the data from all sensor nodes and sends it to a computer for further processing and visualization.

## Manufacturing
The PCB was manufactured using a professional PCB manufacturing service. The components were soldered using a reflow soldering process to ensure proper connections and reliability.
