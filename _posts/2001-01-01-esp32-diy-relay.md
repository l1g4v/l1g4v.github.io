This is a relay PCB based on ESP32 manufactured in DIY way. The main goal of this project was to create a low-cost and easy-to-assemble relay PCB that can be used for home automation. Also during this time (Circa 2016) PCB manufacturing services were quite expensive, so I decided to make it myself.

## Design

The PCB was designed using KiCad.

## Manufacturing

The manufacturing process involved painting a copper-clad board black, then using a laser to burn the design onto the board. After that, the board was etched using a ferric chloride solution to remove the unwanted copper. Then, the board was drilled and components were soldered onto it. Finally, the board was coated with a protective layer to prevent oxidation using "liquid tin".
